realtime estimation

Object detection from a 2D camera (webcam) and distance estimation from a 3D sensor (nimbus 3D) using a Raspberry Pi 4. For object detection a pre trained model is used. Later we map the bounding box coordinates of the object 'person' with the nimbus 3D and measure the distance simulataneously in real time.
